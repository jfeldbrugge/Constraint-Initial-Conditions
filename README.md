# Constraint Initial Conditions

This code is an implementation of the Hoffman-Ribak method for the generation of constraint Gaussian random fields. The Fortran code was developed and is in detail described in [Rien van de Weygaert and Edmund Bertschinger (1996)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996MNRAS.281...84V/abstract). The Python code is a modern incarnation designed for the construction of initial conditions corresponding to a cosmological wall of the cosmic web.
