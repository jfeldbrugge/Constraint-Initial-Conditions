# Constraint Initial Conditions

This code is an implementation of the Hoffman-Ribak method for the generation of constraint Gaussian random fields. The code was developed and is in detail described in [Rien van de Weygaert and Edmund Bertschinger (1996)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996MNRAS.281...84V/abstract).
